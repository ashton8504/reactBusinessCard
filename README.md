Project Name: React Business Card

This project, "React Business Card," was a solo project completed as part of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path. It was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The core concepts explored in this project revolved around gaining a basic understanding of React and its key features. Here are the topics that were covered:

Composability and Declarative Nature of React:

- The project highlighted the benefits of React's composability, allowing developers to build complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components.
- React's declarative nature, where developers describe what they want the UI to look like, rather than worrying about the specific implementation details, was also emphasized.

JSX Syntax:

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files.
The project explored the use of JSX for creating component templates, making it easier to write and visualize the structure of the UI.
Custom Components:

- The project focused on building custom components to represent different sections of the business card.
Custom components provided modularity and reusability, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.

Styling React with CSS:

- The project demonstrated how to apply styles to React components using CSS.

- CSS classes and styles were applied to various components to achieve the desired visual appearance.

The goal of the project was to create a static page representing a business card using React components. By completing this project, I gained the following key takeaways:

- Understanding the benefits of React's composability and declarative nature.
- Proficiency in writing JSX syntax to define component templates.
- Creating and utilizing custom components for building modular UIs.
- Applying CSS styles to React components to enhance the visual presentation.
